LJSpeech/wavs_prof/1.wav|Now what is the plane for you for next step.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/2.wav|use it first step use it lets test it was binary fist lets see how that is improved but atleast.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/3.wav|Yes first try with binary segmentation lets see what the.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/4.wav|do it first do it one by one
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/5.wav|so Finish this one then we talk about next step.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/6.wav|let him try the binary segmentation first lets see whats the results here.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/7.wav|yeah but anyway i cant see the real screen.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/8.wav|as i said last time you focus on majorly hosted from here.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/9.wav|This seems the page is a littlebit the possible can you make the bigger.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/10.wav|So as i said next time first host in desktop so now i think for this you see is annoying reason.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/11.wav|So next time hosted in the desktop so that it would be easier.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/12.wav|you can go back to update here so in this case it takes while so that we dont how what is happeing here.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/13.wav|yes because now it just waste of time because see i believe you changed something but we cannt see it right.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/14.wav|I mean you could use that weight is you have a test did you did you have a test or not yet.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/15.wav|overall it seems fine but it just about the last section of the.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/16.wav|Yeah, I see the similar videos that.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/17.wav|Yes, that's fine. So but as I said, let's let him try them.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/18.wav|Finally, it's commentation first. Let's see what's the results here.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/19.wav|For the fire. What is a previous one?
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/20.wav|But anyway, I cannot see the screen. Anyway, so then let's.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/21.wav|So what about your website part.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/22.wav|Did you change that or not Not yet.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/23.wav|So next time, maybe I will talk to you later for the next time. But for this one, yes, you can shoot now for us. Yeah, Professor, the homepage I updated the, the team background, everything I updated.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/24.wav|So now I click the more the same as the pages are a little bit smaller. Can you make it a bigger.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/25.wav|Yes, yes, Professor. But once you click that again, it doesn't work right, learn more or after you click on the more it changes to another button, show less like that.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/26.wav|So now, you have still have the more here it seems weird once you click a.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/27.wav|So now once you click you cannot click it again right.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/28.wav|But anyway, Jesse's out of the park.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/29.wav|Check the description why I did not change.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/30.wav|So as I said, next time, first the host in the desktop. So now I think is because this, you see is a knowing reason is just a big compiling is rebuilding there.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/31.wav|So next time host the desktop so that it will be easier, right.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/32.wav|So yes, so that's the reason I said that next time, please do host it from desktop not here. Did you call that part.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/33.wav|Okay, good. So now who is the next group.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/34.wav|Yes, you can try to level one more data set if you think some part is not covered. It is possible.
LJSpeech/wavs_prof/35.wav|That's fine. So the year edition, I got the update that for the grant proposal part. Overall, overall it seems fine but it's just about the last section of the
