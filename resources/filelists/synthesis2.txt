Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have shown promising performance for speech synthesis. However, a large number of iterative steps are required to achieve high sample quality, which restricts the inference speed. Maintaining sample quality while increasing sampling speed has become a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a Consistency Model-based Speech synthesis method, CoMoSpeech, which achieve speech synthesis through a single diffusion sampling step while achieving high audio quality. The consistency constraint is applied to distill a consistency model from a well-designed diffusion-based teacher model, which ultimately yields superior performances in the distilled CoMoSpeech. Our experiments show that by generating audio recordings by a single sampling step, the CoMoSpeech achieves an inference speed more than 150 times faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, which is comparable to FastSpeech2, making diffusion-sampling based speech synthesis truly practical. Meanwhile, objective and subjective evaluations on text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis show that the proposed teacher models yield the best audio quality, and the one-step sampling based CoMoSpeech achieves the best inference speed with better or comparable audio quality to other conventional multi-step diffusion model baselines.
